Many a times we need to check the user names and list of users logged in a particular system/session.

This script is a very simple and interactive as well as easy to understand while operating and will provide us with 3 informations as per user demand.

1.Number of users logged in
2.List of all the users
3.Information regarding the Current user

To use this script just download the script file and go to the file location and open terminal and execute the command to provide with executable info.

			chmod +x script2.sh

and once permissions are provided do run the command 
			bash script2.sh 
to run the script

Feel free to connect with Me in case of any query.

Thank you
