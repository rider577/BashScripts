Often we need to check the the system details for various various reason and we can use either gui method and this script is a CLI way to check the System and hardware info.

This script is a very simple and interactive as well as easy to understand while operating and will provide us with 3 informations as per user demand.

1.Hard disk information

To use this script just download the script file and go to the file location and open terminal and execute the command to provide with executable info.

			chmod +x script3.sh

and once permissions are provided do run the command 
			bash script3.sh 
to run the script
