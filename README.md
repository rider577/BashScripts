# BashScripts

This repository contains a collection of bash scripts that are written for various purposes. The scripts are organized into folders based on their purpose. Bash scripts are basically a list of instructions to tell another program what to do.

## Aim

The repo aims at having shell scripts that ease a normal user's life, or add enhancements. These scripts act as multiple components adding towards the same goal.

## Add your bash scripts that you believe can make life easy.

### For example:

- It can be a script that allows one to update/upgrade his distro in just one command

- A script that simplifies the installation of tools/packages for someone who is newbie

- A script that changes the shell theme/icon theme/font on each reboot of the system (that would give a fresh look after every reboot)

- A script that checks the health of system and reports in terminal (using ascii art/or any other method [you may use all that is available to you, to make good things look more beautiful]) that is appealing
